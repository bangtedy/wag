### Definisi Agribisnis

* Agribusiness involves the production, distribution,
and consumption of food, clothing, and even shelter. 
* It includes all economic activity in the food and
fiber system: the input supply industries, agricultural production, and post-harvest, value-added activities such as commodity processing, food manufacturing, and food distribution.

* Most people understand and see its parts, but relatively few
see the industry in its entirety. 

* In 1957 one ground-breaking book, A Concept of Agribusiness --> The book debuted
the term “agribusiness.”

### Today

* Agribusiness firms ranging from large multinational corporations to
emerging food manufacturing and input supply firms 
* A strong demand for more and better employees trained in both management and
agricultural sciences.

### The Core Industries

* Everyone knows what “business” is --> how about Agribusiness?
* Agribusiness involves:
  1. inputs—seeds, fertilizer, financing, equipment—that are used in 
 production; 
  2. intermediate activities— grading, storage, processing, packaging, distribution, pricing, marketing; and 
  3. final consumption activities—restaurants, groceries.

* The input supply industries, production agriculture, and value-
added activities are considered the agribusiness core
industries. 
* Similarly, these core industries use the material and services of certain ancillary industries which are considered agribusiness support
industries.

* Farming (on farm activities) are part of the core of
agribusiness, representing its production process
stage. 
* So, while they are part of agribusiness, they are
not the end; in fact, they are not even the beginning.

### Model Manajemen Agribisnis

* For centuries, agricultural productivity came
from the application of two resources: land and
labor. 

* More recently a substantial proportion of
increased productivity in agriculture output has come from the use of another
resource: capital, primarily in the form of technological change including biotechnology, improved animal husbandry, and improvements in machinery and
chemicals.

* Future improvements will come from the application of a fourth resource: management.

* The industry needs individuals who can harness resources to
move a perishable product around the globe to sustain another equally perishable entity on our planet: people. 

* _Understanding how to do that is what management is all about_.

### The Chain of Agribusiness—The Value Chain

* The linkages between the agribusiness industry activities are frequently referred to as the chain of agribusiness. 
* This chain can be further refined as the agribusiness value chain.
* It begins with raw materials and commodities of relatively low value; then each step in the chain modifies the material or commodity and adds value to the
product derived from its step.

* Growers harvest raw fruits or vegetables that are transported
in bulk to processors or wholesalers, where they are
modified or repackaged and transported to grocery chains in processed form or in smaller batches, and finally to local grocers who display and sell the products in quantities more suitable for consumers to purchase.

#### Another way of looking at the term agribusiness

* Agribusiness involves all the value chain activities usually associated with a business or industry with the additional provision that most of
the materials, commodities, and end products are **perishable** (ringkih, gampang rusak, cepat busuk). 
* The perishable nature of a product, along with variability in such factors as color, texture, size, and shape, is the distinguishing characteristic
of agribusiness products and industries from other
businesses. 

* This aspect of the agribusiness industry is also a key factor in all business decisions. 

* For this reason the story of Ayam Geprek, or Bebek Goreng or Kios Buah is an agribusiness story. 
* Bagaimana dengan Warteg, Warung Padang, Warung Nasi Pecel dan Rawon?
* Its entire business system involved a highly perishable commodity: daging ayam, beras, bumbu-bumbu, minyak goreng, dll.

### Diskusi

* Berikan contoh perusahaan, usaha, kegiatan yang bisa dikategorikan sebagai agribisnis disekitar Anda! 
* Bagaimana dengan peluang usaha di bidang Agribisnis di sekitar Anda?
